"""Shared connection-pool helper for the REST-backed router tools.

Opening a fresh ``httpx.AsyncClient`` per request forces a new TCP + TLS
handshake to the same host on every call. The REST plugins (gmail, vercel)
issue several such calls per user turn and across a session, so that repeated
handshake is a real, avoidable slice of the "plugin call takes ages" latency.
This helper hands back ONE client per tool instance and keeps its connections
warm (HTTP keep-alive) across calls.

The client is rebound whenever the running event loop changes, so a cached
client is never reused across loops — each ``pytest-asyncio`` test runs in its
own loop, and a tool instance reused across loops would otherwise raise
``RuntimeError: Event loop is closed``.
