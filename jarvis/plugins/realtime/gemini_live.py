    grounding (BUG-088).

    Gemini 3.1 Live accepts ``client_content`` ONLY as declared initial
    history: the connection config must set
    ``history_config.initial_history_in_client_content`` (done in
    ``open_session``) and the server then processes ``client_content``
    messages *until* one arrives with ``turn_complete=True`` — only after
    that boundary is ``realtime_input`` (microphone audio) legal. The first
    seed implementation sent ``turn_complete=False`` without the
    declaration; the server closed every rebuilt connection with ``1007
    invalid argument`` ~70 ms after ready, three rebuilds burned the whole
    recovery window, and the call ended reason=error mid-sentence (live
    incident 2026-07-21 08:35, BUG-104).
