"""Pure rendering math + drawing for the whisper bar.

No tkinter, no I/O — every function is deterministic given its inputs, so the
visual behaviour is unit-testable. ``JarvisBarRenderer.render`` returns a PIL
image with a magenta color-key background that the Tk surface keys out.

State → look:
- ``idle``   → muted grey dots in a collapsed pill
- ``listen`` → gold equalizer bars, height driven by the live mic level
- ``speak``  → gold equalizer bars, height driven by the live TTS level
- ``think``  → the "orbital core": a breathing gold core with two comet
               sparks counter-orbiting on tilted ellipses (synthetic,
               ignores level). Replaced the old travelling sine wave,
               which read as a generic-AI visual.
- ``dictate``              → the equalizer, driven by the dictation mic level.
- ``dictate_transcribing`` → the orbital core: recording has stopped and the
               transcription is running, so there IS something to represent.
- ``notice``  → a breathing red cross in an opened pill: something the user
               asked for did not happen. The bar carries no text, so this look
               IS the message on this surface.

Gold only appears during activity; idle dots stay muted.

    Muted standby is the exception: instead of collapsing to the tiny empty
    pill (where the red rim is a hairline and the mic glyph is hidden), the
    muted bar stays at the OPEN size so the slashed-mic + red rim stay visible.
    A muted user is otherwise trapped — they can't unmute by voice (Jarvis is
    deaf while muted), so the click target must always be on screen.

    ``drop_open`` opens the pill for the same reason during a drag-drop: the
    resting pill is ~37x6 px on a 1440p monitor (and ~22x4 at the smallest "Bar
    size"), which is both a punishing target to release a file on and far too
    small to render a legible tick in. Opening on the first drag-enter turns
    the sliver into a real landing zone and gives the confirmation room to
    show.

    The dictation modes are ACTIVE too. Callers pass either the EFFECTIVE mode
    (``render``, where a dictation mode has already resolved to ``speak`` /
    ``think``) or the COARSE mode (the Qt surface's hover-footprint probe) — so
    listing them keeps the hit-box the user can hover in step with the pill the
    renderer actually draws during a dictation.

    ``notice`` opens the pill for the same reason a drop verdict does, and no
    further: the resting pill is a ~37x6 px sliver with no room to draw a
    legible mark in, while the 2x ACTIVE size would make a passing message look
    like a live session. OPEN is the size at which the answer is readable and

    """Derive the rendered look from the coarse mode + actual audio activity.

    The bar's look is driven by ACTUAL audio, not by the supervisor state: the
    supervisor flips LISTENING/THINKING/SPEAKING in ways that don't line up with
    when sound is audible (TTS synthesis is silent for 0.5–20 s after the
    SPEAKING transition; continue-listening flips back to LISTENING mid-playback
    while Jarvis is still talking). So:

    The orbital core (the animated "indicator") belongs ONLY to active
    thinking. Three distinct looks:

    - ``idle`` → ``idle`` (the standby pill). Silence here is not "thinking".
    - Real sound — ``playback_active`` (TTS audio on the device right now) OR a
      recent level within ``hold_s`` (your live mic) → the equalizer (``"speak"``
      → bars that move with the sound). ``playback_active`` is the player's
      authoritative signal, needed because the level tap only fires at
      buffer-write time (a brief instant per sentence) while the player then
      blocks for the whole multi-second playback with no further level.
    - Silent + ``coarse_mode == "think"`` (the THINKING state, and the silent
      TTS-synthesis lead-in which the bridge also shows as ``"think"``) → the
      orbital core. This is the only place an indicator animates.
    - Silent + any OTHER active state (``"listen"`` — waiting after "Hey Jarvis"
      with no speech) → ``"speak"`` too, but with no level the equalizer renders
      flat and STILL: bars that just stand there, no indicator. "When nothing
      happens, nothing happens."

    ``hold_s`` bridges the short gaps between words/sentences so the bars don't
    flap back on every micro-pause.

    Dictation runs outside the voice state machine entirely and has two modes
    of its own, both resolved BEFORE the audio-activity branches so neither can
    be overruled by a stale level sample:

    - ``dictate`` (the user is speaking into the dictation mic) always renders
      as the equalizer. A SPEAKING dictation must never show the thinking core:
      the mic level is being fed, so a silent pause mid-sentence shows still
      bars rather than falling through and pretending to think.
    - ``dictate_transcribing`` (the key was released, the transcription is
      running) renders as the orbital core. Here there genuinely IS work in
      flight to represent, and the mic feed has stopped — showing the equalizer
      would claim the bar is still listening when it is not.

    ``notice`` is resolved first and passes through unchanged. It is the one
    look that must survive EVERY other signal: it is raised precisely when
    something did not happen, and a stale level sample or an in-flight playback
    must never be able to repaint it as listening or speaking — that would
    replace the answer to the user's key press with a lie about the microphone.
