"""Click/drag classification, placement, and position persistence for the bar.

The pure helpers (``is_drag``, ``classify_release``, ``default_bottom_center``,
``clamp_to_screen``) mirror the orb's proven movement-threshold model
(overlay.py:1604): a press that never moves past the threshold is a CLICK
(→ start a voice session); a press that moves past it is a DRAG (→ reposition
+ persist). No duration gate is needed — moving the pointer arms a drag.

Persistence uses a dedicated top-level ``[jarvisbar]`` TOML section (absolute
x/y) so it never clobbers the orb's ``[overlay.mascot]`` pin, and serialises
through ``config_writer._WRITE_LOCK`` so it cannot race other config writes
(AP-7). The orb's own writer predates that lock; ours is stricter.

    Returns one of ``"hangup"`` / ``"mute"`` / ``"talk"`` / ``"none"``.

    The RIGHT zone is the microphone mute toggle (mic muted FOR JARVIS only —
    non-destructive, so it keeps a generous zone). When IDLE, a click anywhere
    starts a normal session.

    The hang-up X is different: it ENDS the session, so its hit-box is
    deliberately narrow and must match what the user can see. The renderer draws
    the close-X ONLY while the bar is ``hovered`` (and as a small glyph at
    ``cx - 0.42*pw``), so a hang-up fires ONLY when (a) the controls are shown
    (``hovered``) AND (b) the click lands on the X glyph itself. A low-intent
    click on the active bar's body — where no X is visible — returns ``"none"``
    instead of silently hanging up. This closes the "Jarvis hangs up by itself"
    trap (live bug 2026-06-19): the old code hung up on ANY click in the left
    40% of the bar, decoupled from the visible affordance.

    EVERY dictation mode (``dictate`` while recording, ``dictate_transcribing``
    while the text is being produced) is inert on purpose: without this branch
    they would fall through to "not active" and a stray click would START A
    VOICE SESSION in the middle of dictating. There is always another way to
    stop — release the key, press it again in toggle mode, the Dictation view,
    or ``jarvis api dictation stop`` — so an inert bar costs nothing and cannot
    misfire.

    ``NOTICE_MODES`` is inert for the same reason and one more. A notice is a
    transient ANSWER, not a control: it appears unrequested, it opens the pill
    under wherever the pointer happens to be, and it clears itself a moment
    later. Letting it resolve a click would mean a click aimed at the bar's
    resting state lands on whatever the notice replaced it with — starting a
    voice session or toggling the mic by accident. Worse, a notice can be raised
    WHILE a conversation is live (a refused dictation says so mid-session), and
    the "not active → talk" fall-through would then fire a second session on a
    bar the user could not see the truth of.
