/**
 * Honest "can I speak yet?" indicator.
 *
 * The desktop window appears within ~1 s, but the wake word is not actually
 * ready until the wake model has loaded (a few seconds later — longer on a cold
 * cache). Backend made honest 2026-06-27: `voiceReady` now flips to true only
 * once the wake model can really hear (see jarvis/speech/pipeline.py). This
 * banner surfaces that gap PROMINENTLY (not just a sidebar dot) so users don't
 * speak too early and think the system is broken:
 *   - while warming  -> amber "{name} is starting up / getting ready to listen"
 *     (the `{name}` i18n token resolves to the configured assistant name,
 *     falling back to the neutral "Assistant" — never a hardcoded brand)
 *   - on becoming ready -> a brief green "Ready — you can speak now" confirmation
