 * fires to rescue a graph the user has dragged off-screen. The result was the
 * reported bug: drag the network toward an edge and it vanishes ("the right
 * wall disappears"), with no way back except the Zentrieren button.
 *
 * The guarantee: after a pan, at least `minVisibleFraction` of each viewport
 * dimension keeps overlapping the graph's bounding box — but never more overlap
 * than the graph actually spans (a graph smaller than the viewport stays FULLY
 * visible instead of being stranded the moment its centre leaves the screen).
 *
 * Pure + framework-free so it is unit-testable without a canvas. The component
 * feeds it `centerAt()` / `zoom()` / `getGraphBbox()` from `onZoomEnd` and only
 * issues a corrective `centerAt()` when the returned centre actually moved.
 *
 * @param center  current camera centre, graph coordinates
 * @param zoom    current zoom factor (screen px per graph unit)
 * @param bbox    graph bounding box, graph coordinates
 * @param view    viewport size in CSS pixels
