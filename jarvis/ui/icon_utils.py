    Tkinter registers its window class *without* a class-icon slot, so a

    process icon: on Windows the taskbar/titlebar falls back to
    ``pythonw.exe`` → the blue/yellow Python logo, on Linux to the generic
    ``python3`` interpreter icon. Both are the same "shows Python, not Jarvis"
    symptom (BUG #UI-Pin-2026-05-05). Any Tk surface — the JarvisBar, the orb,
    any future Tk dialog — must call this once, right after creating its root,
    or it will visibly regress to the Python logo.

    Two OS-specific paths, because the toolkits read different surfaces:

    **Windows** — the taskbar renders the window *class* icon, and the
    highest-fidelity source is the multi-resolution ``jarvis.ico``:

      1. ``ensure_windows_app_identity`` — group this process under the Jarvis
         taskbar button (idempotent across processes).
      2. ``iconbitmap(default=.ico)`` — Tk-level icon for all toplevels.
      3. ``WM_SETICON`` + ``SetClassLongPtrW`` — the Win32 class-icon override,
         the only surface the taskbar actually reads.

    ``iconphoto`` (the PNG path) is deliberately NOT used on Windows: Tk
    re-asserts a ``PhotoImage``-derived class icon on later map/update cycles,
    which races and overwrites our ``SetClassLongPtrW`` — the live window ended
    up with a blank/greyed class icon. The ``.ico`` + Win32 path is the proven
    one (BUG #UI-Pin-2026-05-05).

    **Linux / macOS** — Tk exposes no class-icon slot to Win32, but its portable
    ``root.iconphoto`` sets ``_NET_WM_ICON``, which is exactly what the
    dock/taskbar reads. It needs a PNG (most Linux desktops and Tk cannot decode
    a Windows ``.ico``). The ``PhotoImage`` is stashed on the root because Tk
    keeps no reference — without it Python garbage-collects the image and the
    icon silently reverts to the generic ``python3`` interpreter icon.

    Every step is wrapped: the bar/orb are cosmetic and must never crash — or
    block their Tk mainloop — on an icon hiccup. Must run on the Tk thread that
    owns ``root`` (``winfo_id`` / ``PhotoImage`` are thread-affine).
