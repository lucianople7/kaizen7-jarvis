"""Bundled binary assets shipped with the Jarvis package.

Currently:
- ``wakeword/``: the word-agnostic openWakeWord feature backbones
  (melspectrogram, embedding) that a user-trained custom wake model needs to
  load offline. NO named wake model ships (design 2026-07-07). Loaded via
  :func:`bundled_wakeword_models` from the openWakeWord provider.
- ``vad/``: the Silero VAD ONNX model (MIT-licensed, ~2.2 MB) that powers
  end-of-speech detection (:mod:`jarvis.audio.vad`). Bundled so the core voice
  loop closes a turn on every install profile without the redundant
  ``silero-vad`` pip package or torch. The model is run through base CPU
  ``onnxruntime``. Loaded via
  :func:`bundled_silero_vad_model`.
- ``icons/``: the desktop/taskbar icon (the Gigi ghost mascot), in two formats:
  ``jarvis.ico`` for every Win32 icon surface (window class icon, AUMID icon,
  Start-Menu + autostart shortcut, taskbar name) and ``jarvis.png`` for the
  Linux XDG ``.desktop`` ``Icon=`` key (most Linux desktops cannot render
  ``.ico``). Bundled so both can be found regardless of how the package was
  installed. Loaded via :func:`bundled_app_icon` / :func:`bundled_app_icon_png`.
  The ``.ico`` is byte-identical to the build-tool copy at
  ``<repo-root>/assets/icons/jarvis.ico`` (kept in sync by
  ``tests/unit/ui/test_icon_identity.py``).

Future bundles (e.g. packaged voice clips) live under this package.

    resolves only for a run *from the project folder* (``parents[2]`` == repo
    root); a real ``pip install`` puts the package under ``site-packages`` where
    that repo-root ``assets/`` does not exist, so every Win32 icon surface (class
    icon, AUMID icon, Start-Menu shortcut, taskbar name) silently fell back to
