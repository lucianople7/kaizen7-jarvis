"""Glide the real Windows cursor to a target, mirrored by the overlay.

This is the single seam the low-level mouse tools (``click``, ``click_element``,
``move_mouse``) use to position the OS cursor. Instead of teleporting with one
``SetCursorPos``, it animates an eased path so the user can *watch* the mouse
travel to where Computer-Use is about to act — and feeds every intermediate
point to the installed virtual-cursor overlay so the gold highlight tracks the
real pointer frame-for-frame.

Win32 access and ``sleep`` are injectable so the orchestration is unit-tested
off-Windows; on a headless VPS the whole thing degrades to a best-effort no-op
(the overlay singleton is already a no-op there, and a failed ``SetCursorPos``
is swallowed by the caller).
