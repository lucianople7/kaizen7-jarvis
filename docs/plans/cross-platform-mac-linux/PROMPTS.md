## preflight

```prompt

<role>
You are the migration lead bootstrapping the cross-platform (macOS + Linux) port of Personal Jarvis. Your outcome is a clean, verified starting state and the integration branch every later wave merges into — not any feature code. You set the stage; you do not act.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means all of the following are true and demonstrated with command output:
- The repo is on a fresh integration branch `feat/crossplatform-port` cut from the latest `origin/main`, pushed to origin.
- `pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1` exits 0 in the repo root.
- `python -c "import jarvis; print(jarvis.__file__)"` resolves to the live working clone (BUG-006/014 guard).
- The whole cross-platform plan has been read and an at-a-glance wave/dependency map is reproduced in your final report.
- No production file has been modified.
</outcome>

<required-reading>
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/_FROZEN-DECISIONS.md` (the full AD/PC/EK/wave list — read all of it).
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/README.md` (the master plan + the hot-file ownership table).
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/HARD-NEGATIVES.md` — inline-quote HN-15 and HN-17 in your final report:
  - HN-15: "Never merge a wave before its CI matrix (ubuntu-latest + macos-latest + windows-latest) is green for ruff + mypy + pytest -m 'not skip_ci'."
  - HN-17: "Every artifact is English; never git push --force; never --no-verify; never bypass signing."
- `CLAUDE.md` (Output-Language Policy + Worktree activation checklist + git policy).
</required-reading>

<environment-setup>
Run exactly, in the repo root `<USER_HOME>\Desktop\Personal Jarvis`:
1. `git fetch origin`
2. `git switch -c feat/crossplatform-port origin/main`
3. `git push -u origin feat/crossplatform-port`
4. `pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1`   (must exit 0 — if not, STOP and fix before continuing)
5. `python -c "import jarvis; print(jarvis.__file__)"`
Do NOT create a worktree here — this prompt only stands up the integration branch. Sub-task prompts create their own worktrees.
</environment-setup>

<scope>
Create / modify: NOTHING in `jarvis/`. This is a branch + verification step only. (Optional: you may append a one-line note to your own scratch report — never to a plan doc.)
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. Read all required files.
2. Run the environment-setup commands in order, stopping on any non-zero exit.
3. Confirm the integration branch exists on origin (`git ls-remote --heads origin feat/crossplatform-port`).
4. Reproduce the wave dependency map (Wave 0 blocks 1/2/3; Wave 4 needs all of 0-3) in the report.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>
- If `origin/main` is unexpectedly behind a known-good commit, branch from the commit the operator names instead, and record the deviation. Failure condition: `git switch` reports the base ref is missing.
- If `preflight.ps1` fails on a stale editable-install pin, run `pip install -e . --no-deps` then re-run preflight. Failure condition: preflight still non-zero.
- You may invent a recovery path if both fail, provided you break no INVIOLABLE hard-rule (no force-push, no history rewrite on a shared branch — HN-17).
</fallback-paths>

<acceptance>
git ls-remote --heads origin feat/crossplatform-port
pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1
python -c "import jarvis; print(jarvis.__file__)"
git status --porcelain
</acceptance>

<hard-rules>
INVIOLABLE:
- HN-17 — English-only artifacts; never `git push --force`; never `--no-verify`; never bypass signing.
SOFT:
- Prefer branching from `origin/main`; deviate only with an explicit recorded reason.
</hard-rules>

<done-signal>
Final report (5 bullets):
- Integration branch created + pushed (with the origin hash).
- Preflight + import-clean checks: PASS/FAIL with output.
- Wave dependency map reproduced.
- Hard-rules honored (HN-15/HN-17 quoted).
- Path-taken: primary or which fallback, and why.

# Wave 0 — Foundation (BLOCKING)

> Worktree split (per `WELLE-0-foundation.md` §Parallelism): **0.1+0.2** one worktree (platform module), **0.3+0.4+0.5** one worktree (CI workflow), **0.6+0.7** one worktree (orb-conflict). Merge order: platform module → conftest cleanup → CI workflow last. Nothing in Waves 1-4 merges until 0.3's matrix is green (AD-4 / HN-15).

## 0.1

```prompt

<role>
You own the shared platform-detection authority for the whole cross-platform port. Your outcome is a single cached, frozen capability source of truth that all six later ports read instead of each re-detecting sys.platform. You are not building any feature — you are building the one module everything else depends on.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means:
- `jarvis/platform/__init__.py` exposes `detect_platform() -> Literal["win32","darwin","linux"]` that maps sys.platform and NEVER raises (unknown → "linux" + one English warning).
- `jarvis/platform/capabilities.py` defines `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True) Capabilities` with exactly the AD-5 fields: `platform: str`, `has_hotkey: bool`, `has_ax_tree: bool`, `has_overlay: bool`, `has_pty: bool`, `has_elevation: bool`, `display_present: bool`, `is_wayland: bool`, `ax_permission_granted: bool | None` (tri-state; document the None="unknown until first use" case).
- `detect_capabilities() -> Capabilities` is cached (lru_cache or module `_CACHED`) so `d() is d()`; `reset_capabilities_cache()` exists as a test hook.
- No module-scope import of `winreg`/`pyobjc`/`pyatspi`/any Windows-only package — all lazy + guarded inside function bodies.
- All acceptance commands pass.
</outcome>

<required-reading>
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/WELLE-0-foundation.md` §0.1 (this exact sub-task).

- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/HARD-NEGATIVES.md` — inline-quote in your report:
  - HN-3: "Never branch on sys.platform inline in a consumer. Read the capability from the shared jarvis/platform/ module."
  - HN-4: "No sys.platform factory branch may EVER raise. An unavailable capability logs one clear English message and returns a null/no-op implementation."
  - HN-7: "Never add a module-scope import of a Windows-only package. Lazy + guarded inside the function/branch only."
- Reference patterns: frozen dataclass style at `jarvis/core/protocols.py:402` (`Observation`); test-reset hook at `jarvis/trigger/hotkey.py:97` (`_reset_checker_state_for_tests`); lazy-guarded import at `jarvis/plugins/tool/app_resolver.py:24`.
</required-reading>

<environment-setup>

</environment-setup>

<scope>

Do NOT modify any existing `jarvis/` file.
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. Write `detect_platform()` in `__init__.py`: `win32`→`win32`, `darwin`→`darwin`, `startswith("linux")`→`linux`, else log + return `linux`.
2. Write `Capabilities` frozen dataclass mirroring `Observation` style; document the tri-state `ax_permission_granted`.
3. Write `detect_capabilities()` computing each field from `jarvis.platform.probes`, wrapped in `functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)`; add `reset_capabilities_cache()` clearing the cache.
4. Write `tests/unit/platform/test_capabilities.py`: cache identity, field presence, monkeypatched-probe → Capabilities mapping. Use a `tests/fakes/`-style fake or direct monkeypatch of probe functions — NOT `unittest.mock`.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>
- If `lru_cache` interferes with the reset hook in tests, use a module-level `_CACHED: Capabilities | None` guard + a `reset_capabilities_cache()` that sets it to None. Failure condition: `d() is d()` returns False.
- If `slots=True` conflicts with a default-factory field, drop `slots=True` (keep `frozen=True`) and note the deviation. Failure condition: dataclass construction raises.

You own the capability probes that answer "what works on this box" — display, Wayland, AX-permission, PTY, elevation, hotkey, overlay, ax-tree. Your outcome is a set of cheap, exception-swallowing boolean probes that feed the frozen Capabilities dataclass from 0.1. Each probe runs once per process and never crashes the import.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means:
- `jarvis/platform/probes.py` defines one small function per Capabilities field, each returning a plain bool (or `bool | None` for `ax_permission_granted`) and swallowing its own exceptions to a logged False/None.
- Every OS-specific import (`winreg`, `Quartz`, `pyatspi`, `winpty`, `pynput`, `tkinter`, …) is lazy inside the function body via `importlib.util.find_spec` or a guarded import — never at module scope.
- `tests/fakes/fake_capabilities.py` exists and constructs a valid `Capabilities` for each of win32/darwin/linux (EK-3 fake, no `unittest.mock`).
- All acceptance commands pass.
</outcome>

Probe field map (WELLE-0 §0.2): `display_present`, `is_wayland`, `has_pty` (winpty/ptyprocess find_spec), `ax_permission_granted` (macOS lazy `AXIsProcessTrusted()` → None if pyobjc absent), `has_ax_tree` (win:pywinauto / mac:Quartz / linux:pyatspi find_spec), `has_hotkey` (win:global_hotkeys / unix:pynput AND not is_wayland), `has_overlay` (display_present AND tkinter find_spec), `has_elevation` (win:win32pipe / mac:True / linux:pkexec|sudo via shutil.which).
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. Write each probe exactly as WELLE-0 §0.2 prescribes; wrap each body in try/except → logged False/None.
2. Write `fake_capabilities.py` with three factory helpers (`win_capabilities()`, `darwin_capabilities()`, `linux_capabilities()`) returning canned `Capabilities`.
3. Write `test_probes.py` monkeypatching `os.environ` (DISPLAY/WAYLAND_DISPLAY/XDG_SESSION_TYPE) and `importlib.util.find_spec`/`shutil.which` to assert each probe's True/False boundary.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>
- If `find_spec` raises for a namespace package, catch it and treat as "absent". Failure condition: probe import throws on a clean Linux box.
- If `AXIsProcessTrusted()` cannot be imported lazily on a non-Mac, return None ("unknown") — that is the designed tri-state. Failure condition: probe raises off-Mac.

You build the highest-leverage missing safety net in the entire project: the GitHub Actions test matrix on ubuntu+macos+windows. There is NO functional CI today (PC-1). Your outcome is a green 3-OS matrix that runs ruff, mypy, pytest, the import-cleanliness gate (0.4), and the min-passed floor (0.5). Until this is green, nothing in Waves 1-4 may merge.

You port the built-in terminal to Unix via a `PtyBackend` seam, with `ptyprocess` as the POSIX backend. This is the standout verification win — a real PTY runs end-to-end on the CI runners.

DONE means:

- `jarvis/terminal/pty_manager.py` routes through the seam: the inline `from winpty import PtyProcess` (`:71`) and the five direct `proc.*` calls (`:127`,`:138`,`:173`,`:193`,`:206`,`:225`) go through `PtyBackend`. The daemon-thread read-loop (`_reader_loop` `:179-239`) stays structurally identical (AD-9: NO async rewrite).
- `UnixPtyBackend.read` decodes bytes→str (utf-8/replace); `write` encodes str→bytes; `spawn` honors `dimensions=(rows, cols)`.
- `make_pty_backend()` returns `UnixPtyBackend` on POSIX, `WinptyBackend` on Windows, and a null backend (whose `spawn` raises a clear English RuntimeError the manager surfaces as a typed error) when `not capabilities.has_pty`.

You add Unix shell discovery to the terminal so the Unix PTY backend has shells to spawn. Your outcome is a `_unix_shells()` branch in `discover_shells()` that finds POSIX shells in preference order, with the four Windows shell factories left completely untouched.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means:

Deduped by resolved path. Each `ShellInfo.argv == (path, "-i")` (interactive, never unconditional `-l`).
- `discover_shells()` (`:71-78`) dispatches on `detect_platform()`: `win32` → the four unchanged Windows factories (`_powershell_7` `:23`, `_windows_powershell` `:35`, `_cmd` `:48`, `_git_bash` `:55`); else → `_unix_shells()`.

The `LaunchKind` Literal (`:30`) gains `"open_a"` and `"xdg_open"`. `_EXE_ALIASES` (`:54`) becomes platform-conditional.
- `jarvis/plugins/tool/open_app.py`: `KNOWN_APPS` (`:23`) selected by `detect_platform()` — keep Windows set as `_KNOWN_APPS_WIN`; add `_KNOWN_APPS_DARWIN` (safari, terminal, finder, calculator, firefox, chrome, vscode, slack, …) and `_KNOWN_APPS_LINUX` (firefox, nautilus, gnome-terminal, gnome-calculator, code, chromium, …) per AD-15. `_is_plausible_app_name` (`:68`), `_APP_NAME_RE`/`_HALLUCINATION_RE` (`:52`/`:58`), and the PATH/URL/path escape hatches (`:81-89`) are reused verbatim. `OpenAppTool.execute` (`:116`) branches launch on `LaunchKind`: `open_a`→`Popen(["open","-a",value,*args])`, `xdg_open`→`Popen(["xdg-open",value])`, `executable`→`Popen([value,*args])`, `startfile`→Windows-only (`:153`).

These carry the BUG fixes — relocate, do not refactor (AD-7).
- `jarvis/trigger/backends/pynput.py` maps jarvis combo syntax (`ctrl+right_alt+j`) to pynput (`<ctrl>+<alt>+j`), keeps a tiny refcount, and on macOS flags "registered but zero events" via `received_any_event()` (AD-8 Input-Monitoring guidance).
- `jarvis/trigger/backends/noop.py` is returned when `not capabilities.has_hotkey` (true on Wayland); logs ONCE the English "global hotkey unavailable on Wayland by OS design; lean on the wake word" message then no-ops.
- `make_hotkey_backend()`: win32→GlobalHotkeysBackend; else if `capabilities.has_hotkey`→PynputBackend; else→NoopBackend.

# Wave 2 — Permission / GUI-heavy ports (parallel)

- pyobjc frameworks (`Quartz`/`ApplicationServices`/`HIServices`) are lazy-imported INSIDE `observe`, never at module scope. Frontmost app via `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication().processIdentifier()`; walk via `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue` (kAXRole/kAXTitle/kAXValue/kAXPosition/kAXSize/kAXEnabled/kAXChildren).
- Roles run through `normalize_role(..., "darwin")` (2.3) while flattening; reuse the existing `_DEPTH_RETRY_LADDER (6,5,4)` (`uia_tree.py:42`) + `prune_tree` (`pruning.py`). AX `{x,y}`+`{w,h}` → `(x,y,w,h)` bounds.
- Permission gate (AD-13): before walking, check `AXIsProcessTrusted()`. If False, log the English onboarding message ("macOS Accessibility permission not granted — grant it in System Settings › Privacy & Security › Accessibility … falling back to pixel clicks") and return an `Observation` with empty `nodes` + `source="screenshot_only"`. Never raise.

You build the Linux orb tiers: a best-effort transparent surface on a compositor and the universal `TrayOnlySurface` floor driving the already-cross-platform pystray tray. Your outcome is graceful orb presence on every Linux session — transparency where the compositor allows it, a state-colored tray icon everywhere else — never an opaque magenta box, never a crash.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means:
- `jarvis/overlay/linux_surface.py` defines `LinuxBestEffortOverlay`: attempts the Tk `-transparentcolor` path on a Linux compositor; on a non-compositing/Wayland session (detect via `capabilities.is_wayland` or a failed `wm_attributes` probe / `TclError`) it FALLS THROUGH to `TrayOnlySurface` with a logged English message. Never shows an opaque magenta box.
- `jarvis/overlay/tray_surface.py` defines `TrayOnlySurface`: drives the existing cross-platform pystray tray (`jarvis/ui/tray.py`, no platform marker, renders `JarvisState` icons via PIL at `tray.py:39`); `set_state(state)` maps the orb state onto `JarvisState` (`tray.py:20-26`) so IDLE/LISTENING/THINKING/SPEAKING feedback shows in the tray color (`_STATE_COLORS` at `tray.py:29`).
- `make_overlay_surface()` (2.5) returns `LinuxBestEffortOverlay` when `display_present and not is_wayland`, else `TrayOnlySurface`.
- `tests/overlay/test_tray_surface.py` green (TrayOnlySurface maps orb states onto `JarvisState` via a fake; no real tray thread). On a headless leg (no DISPLAY) `make_overlay_surface()` returns `TrayOnlySurface` and start/stop are no-op-safe.

# Wave 3 — Admin / elevation (security-sensitive)

> Worktree split (per `WELLE-3-admin.md` §Parallelism): **F=Transport+elevation** (3.1→3.2→3.4→3.6, the security core; 3.1 lands first, then 3.2/3.4 in parallel sub-branches, 3.6 wires last), **G=Op-vocabulary+ADR** (3.3+3.5, independent of the transport seam). Every PR here carries a `requesting-code-review` pass focused on no-`shell=True` / pattern-validated-argv / peer-cred invariants. Depends on Wave 0 only (the platform factory + `has_elevation` probe + the green matrix + the import gate). Independent of Waves 1/2. NEVER CI-testable end-to-end (interactive auth) → relies on Wave 4 live sign-off + heavy fake-transport unit tests.

No behavior change (AD-7); the SDDL-ACL `D:(A;;FA;;;<SID>)` (`:129`) + MESSAGE-mode read still apply.
- The HMAC/envelope core STAYS in `ipc.py` verbatim: `_canonical_args_json` (`:65`), `_compute_hmac` (`:76`), `_decode_request` (`:194`, its 5-step ordering), `_encode_response` (`:258`), the nonce LRU (`:181`), the `_TIMESTAMP_WINDOW_NS`/`_NONCE_LRU_SIZE` constants (`:43-50`).
- `make_admin_transport()`: win32→`NamedPipeTransport`; else→`UnixSocketTransport` (3.2).
- `tests/unit/admin/test_hmac_replay.py` STAYS green (the core is unmoved). `tests/unit/admin/test_transport_seam.py` green (a fake transport round-trips a signed envelope through `_decode_request`/`_encode_response`). `ipc.py` no longer module-scope-imports `win32pipe`/`win32file`/`win32security`/`pywintypes`.

- Peer-credential check on accept: Linux `sock.getsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEERCRED, struct.calcsize("3i"))`→(pid,uid,gid); macOS `LOCAL_PEERCRED`/`getpeereid`. Reject any connection whose UID != the server process UID. The HMAC envelope check (`_decode_request`) still runs on top (defense in depth).

  - macOS: `BrewInstallOp`/`BrewRemoveOp` (`formula` regex), `LaunchctlOp` (`label` regex, `action: load|unload|enable|disable`), `WriteProtectedPathOp` (paths like `/Library/...`).
- `jarvis/admin/schema.py`: the `AdminOperation` union (`:175-192`) + `ADMIN_OPERATION_TYPES` (`:195-209`) + `DESTRUCTIVE_OPS` (`:212`) become platform-conditional (or a superset the executor dispatches per OS). `jarvis/admin/executor.py` gains per-OS argv builders emitting validated argv lists (`["apt-get","install","-y",op.package]`, `["systemctl",op.action,op.unit]`, `["brew","install",op.formula]`, `["launchctl",op.action,op.label]`) — argv only, `shell=False`.
- Destructive ops (`apt_remove`, `systemctl stop/disable`, `ufw_remove`, `brew_remove`, `launchctl unload`, `write_protected_path`) are in `DESTRUCTIVE_OPS` so the per-action approval gate (`client.py:135-139`) fires identically across OSes.

You are a read-only phase auditor for Wave 3 (the security-sensitive admin/elevation wave). Your outcome is a PASS/FAIL verdict on whether the AdminTransport + Elevator seams meet EK-2/EK-3 + the ADR half of EK-6 and are safe to merge — with explicit confirmation that the HMAC core is unchanged, peer-cred is enforced, NullElevator is the default, and end-to-end elevation is correctly NOT CI-verified (deferred to Wave 4). You verify; you do not modify.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means a verdict report stating, with command evidence, whether:
- The HMAC/envelope core is unchanged (`test_hmac_replay.py` green; HN-12).
- `make_admin_transport()` selects per OS; `ipc.py`/`client.py`/`helper.py` are import-clean on POSIX (no module-scope win32; HN-7).
- `UnixSocketTransport` enforces the peer-cred check + 0600/0700 perms; the real AF_UNIX loopback round-trips (HN-13).
- The Unix op vocabulary is fresh members of the same union with pattern-validated argv; a malicious payload is rejected; `shell=True` appears nowhere on the admin path (HN-11/HN-12/AP-7/AP-10).
- `NullElevator` is the default refusal; `make_elevator()` selects per OS; no end-to-end elevation test runs in CI (HN-14/AD-3).
- ADR-0020 supersedes ADR-0001; uniqueness holds (EK-6).

# Wave 4 — Hardening + live sign-off

> Mostly serial and human-gated (per `WELLE-4-hardening.md` §Parallelism): one worktree, sequential 4.1 → 4.2 → (4.3 + 4.4) → 4.6; with 4.5 (JARVIS-20) as an independent side-track sharing the same hardware session. The hardware constraint (a real macOS box + a real Linux desktop) is the bottleneck — if a device is unavailable, record `unverified-on-real-desktop` honestly (AD-3), do not block the wave. NO new feature code lands here — only the verification harness, the sign-off log, and the doc truth-up. Depends on ALL of Waves 0-3 being merged.

## 4.1

```prompt
ultrathink
<role>
You build the live sign-off harness: a checklist of exactly the GUI/permission behaviors CI cannot reach, plus a thin operator-aide probe runner. Your outcome is a per-(feature × OS) manual checklist and a `signoff_probe.py` that constructs each seam via its factory and brackets the manual step — it does NOT try to automate a permission prompt (impossible).
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means:
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/LIVE-SIGNOFF-CHECKLIST.md` exists with ONE row per (feature × {macOS, Linux}) for the four GUI/permission behaviors CI cannot reach: AX/AT-SPI tree capture, Orb transparency, global-hotkey capture, elevation prompt. Each row: the precise manual step, the expected observation, a PASS/FAIL/N/A field. It covers the degrade paths too (revoke permission → onboarding message + pixel fallback; Wayland hotkey no-op; tray fallback).
- `scripts/crossplatform/signoff_probe.py` constructs each seam via its factory (`make_ui_tree_source`, `make_overlay_surface`, `make_hotkey_backend`, `make_admin_transport`/`make_elevator`), runs the live action on the matching OS, and prints what the operator should observe. `--list` prints the probe catalog on ANY OS without raising (acts only on the matching OS).
- `python scripts/crossplatform/signoff_probe.py --list` runs on any OS without raising; `ruff check scripts/crossplatform/` clean.
</outcome>

<required-reading>
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/WELLE-4-hardening.md` §4.1 (the exact per-feature manual steps).
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/_FROZEN-DECISIONS.md` AD-3 (CI + one-time live sign-off) + AD-13 (detect-and-degrade) + AD-8 (Wayland no-op / macOS Input-Monitoring).
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/HARD-NEGATIVES.md` — inline-quote HN-6 ("Never claim a GUI/permission feature 'works' without a live sign-off. CI-green is NOT sufficient…") and HN-4 (the probe never raises off-OS).
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/ANTI-PATTERNS.md` AP-9 (no real display in CI — the probe is an operator aide, not a CI test) + AP-2 (distinguish empty from forbidden).
- The six factory entry points from Waves 1-3 (read their signatures).
</required-reading>

<environment-setup>
1. `pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1`
2. `git worktree add -b crossplat/w4-signoff ../sub-agents-outputs/crossplat-w4-signoff feat/crossplatform-port`
3. `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

<scope>
Create: `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/LIVE-SIGNOFF-CHECKLIST.md`, `scripts/crossplatform/signoff_probe.py` (+ `scripts/crossplatform/__init__.py` if needed). Worktree owns 4.1→4.2→4.3→4.4→4.6. No production-code edits.
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. Write the checklist: one row per (feature × OS) for the four behaviors + their degrade paths, each with step/expected/verdict-field.
2. Write `signoff_probe.py`: `--list` prints the catalog; each `--feature` flag constructs the matching factory + runs the live action + prints the expected observation; off-OS → print "N/A on this platform" and exit 0 (never raise).
3. `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')` at the top.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>
- If a factory needs runtime config the probe can't supply headless, have the probe construct it lazily and print the manual prerequisite instead of failing. Failure condition: `--list` raises on any OS.
- You may structure the checklist table however reads clearly, provided it has one row per (feature × {macOS, Linux}) for the four behaviors (and the degrade paths).

<hard-rules>
INVIOLABLE:
- HN-6 — the harness frames the live sign-off as the ONLY way to claim GUI/permission features work; CI-green is not enough.
- HN-4 / AP-9 — `signoff_probe.py --list` never raises off-OS; it is an operator aide, never a CI test; no real display required to list.
SOFT:
- Cover the degrade paths (revoke → fallback; Wayland no-op; tray) as explicit rows.
</hard-rules>

<done-signal>
Final report (5 bullets):
- The checklist row coverage (4 behaviors × 2 OSes + degrade paths).

## 4.2

```prompt
ultrathink
<role>
You execute the live sign-off on a real macOS box and a real Linux desktop and record an honest, dated, device-attributed per-feature verdict. Your outcome is `SIGNOFF-LOG.md` where every GUI/permission row carries either `live-verified <date> on <device>` or an explicit `unverified-on-real-desktop` with the reason — honesty over a green-washed claim.

<outcome>
DONE means:

3. This sub-task is HUMAN-GATED — it requires the operator at a real macOS box and a real Linux desktop.
</environment-setup>

<scope>
Create: `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/SIGNOFF-LOG.md`. No production-code edits.
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. On the macOS device: run the AX, Orb-transparency, hotkey-capture, and elevation-prompt probes per the checklist; record each verdict with date + device.
2. On the Linux desktop: run the AT-SPI, Orb (compositor + tray fallback), hotkey (X11 vs Wayland), and elevation (pkexec/sudo/null) probes; record each verdict.
3. For any unreachable behavior, record `unverified-on-real-desktop` + the reason.
4. Cross-check that every 4.1 row has a verdict line.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>

# Recovery prompts

> Recovery needs exact state, not creativity — these are step-prescriptive. Each diagnoses first, then applies the minimal safe fix, and NEVER resolves a problem by breaking an INVIOLABLE rule (no force-push, no `--no-verify`, no lowering the min-passed floor, no removing a regression guard or a security invariant).

## recovery-rate-limited

```prompt
ultrathink
<role>
You recover a coding-agent session that stalled or failed due to API/tool rate-limiting (429s, OAuth-concurrency saturation, throttled subprocess workers). Your outcome is the in-progress sub-task brought back to a clean, resumable state without losing committed work — by reducing concurrency and resuming, not by abandoning the branch.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means: the cause of the rate-limit is identified (which provider/tool, concurrency vs quota); in-flight work is preserved (committed on the sub-task branch); concurrency is reduced to a safe level; and either the sub-task resumes cleanly OR a clear "resume here" handoff is recorded. No work is lost; no branch is force-reset.
</outcome>

<required-reading>
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/HARD-NEGATIVES.md` HN-17 (never force-push; never bypass hooks).
- The sub-task prompt that was running (its `<done-signal>` defines what "resume here" means).
- MEMORY: the mission mass-failure root cause was OAuth-concurrency saturation (fix = First-Output-Gate + max_concurrent 1) — relevant if the rate-limit is on the worker/Jarvis-Agent path.
</required-reading>

<environment-setup>
1. `git status` (in the affected worktree) — confirm whether uncommitted work exists.
2. `git stash list` and `git log --oneline -5` — locate the last good commit.
</environment-setup>

<scope>
Modify: only what is needed to reduce concurrency (e.g. a worker `max_concurrent` setting) + commit in-flight work. Do NOT edit unrelated files.
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. Diagnose: read the error — identify the provider/tool and whether it is a quota cap or concurrency saturation.
2. Preserve: `git add -A && git commit -m "wip: <sub-task> checkpoint before rate-limit recovery"` on the sub-task branch (NEVER on a shared branch directly; NEVER `git add .` blindly — review the diff first).
3. Reduce concurrency: if it is OAuth-concurrency (Jarvis-Agent/worker path), set the relevant `max_concurrent` to 1; if it is a per-provider quota, switch provider via ENV (e.g. `brain.primary`→an alternate) per the project's drift-safe config path (ENV override, not a raw toml edit).
4. Wait for the limit window to clear (do not hammer-retry in a tight loop), then re-run the sub-task's acceptance commands to confirm the resumable state.
5. Record a "resume here" note (which acceptance commands still need to pass).
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>
- If the rate-limit is global and persistent, record the checkpoint commit + a handoff and STOP — let the operator decide when to resume. Failure condition: retries keep 429-ing.
- If switching provider, use the ENV-override path (drift-guard-safe), never a raw `jarvis.toml` edit that a parallel session could roll back.
- Never delete `jarvis.lock` manually (MEMORY: that breaks the lock-holder sweep contract).
</fallback-paths>

<acceptance>
git status --porcelain

INVIOLABLE:
- HN-17 — no force-push; no `--no-verify`; commit in-flight work rather than discarding it.
- Never `git add .` blindly (review the diff); never manually delete `jarvis.lock`.
SOFT:
- Prefer ENV-override provider switch over a raw toml edit.
</hard-rules>

## recovery-red-ci

```prompt
ultrathink
<role>
You recover a red CI matrix run. Your outcome is a correctly-diagnosed failure (which OS leg, which step, real failure vs mass-skip vs flake) and a minimal fix that turns the matrix genuinely green — never by lowering the min-passed floor, widening skip_ci to dodge a real failure, or weakening a regression guard.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means: the red leg + failing step is identified from the run logs; the failure is classified (real test failure / import-cleanliness violation / min-passed-floor shortfall / mass-skip / flake); the minimal honest fix is applied on the appropriate branch; and the matrix is re-run green on all three legs. No floor lowered, no skip_ci widened to hide a real failure, no guard removed.
</outcome>

<required-reading>

</required-reading>

<environment-setup>
1. `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --branch <branch> --limit 3`
2. `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` — read the failing step on each red leg.
3. `git switch <the branch whose PR is red>`; `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
</environment-setup>

<scope>
Modify: only the file(s) causing the red. Do NOT touch `scripts/ci/assert_min_passed.py`'s FLOOR (except to bump it FORWARD if the green count legitimately rose) and do NOT add `skip_ci` to dodge a real failure.
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. Classify the failure from the logs:
   - **Import-cleanliness red** (Linux/macOS `import jarvis` fails / the AST gate flags a module-scope Windows import) → move the offending import inside the function/branch, lazy + guarded (HN-7/AP-13). Reproduce locally: `python scripts/ci/check_import_clean.py`.
   - **Min-passed-floor shortfall** (passed < FLOOR with zero failures) → this is a MASS-SKIP, not a pass: find the collection error / swallowed import that dropped the count; fix the root cause. NEVER lower the floor (HN-16/AP-6).
   - **Real test failure** → fix the code or the test honestly; do not reverse-patch the test to pass (HN-2).
   - **Flake** (passes locally, intermittent on the runner) → confirm it is truly non-deterministic (re-run); if a GUI/display test sneaked into CI, mark it `skip_ci` and move it to the live sign-off (AP-9) — but ONLY a genuinely-headless-impossible test, never a real failure.
2. Apply the minimal fix on the right branch.
3. Re-run the relevant acceptance locally, push, and watch the matrix.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>
- If the failure is on a single OS leg only (e.g. macos-latest), reproduce the platform-specific cause via the capability/probe path before editing; do not "fix" by branching inline on sys.platform (HN-3). Failure condition: the fix passes one leg but reds another.
- If the green count legitimately rose, bump FLOOR FORWARD (never down) and note it. Failure condition: lowering FLOOR to pass.
- If the root cause is genuinely unclear after log review, add targeted logging and re-run rather than guessing a fix (systematic-debugging).

1. For the COMMON conflict shapes in this migration:
   - **`pyproject.toml` extras** (Wave-1 `[desktop]` vs Wave-2 `[desktop-macos]`): keep BOTH groups; ensure `pynput`/`ptyprocess` in `[desktop]`, `pyobjc-*` in `[desktop-macos]`, and NO pyatspi anywhere (HN-9). Verify with tomllib.
   - **`jarvis/admin/schema.py` / `executor.py`** (Wave-3 op tables): keep the full superset union; the Windows ops are not narrowed; the Unix ops keep pattern-validated argv (HN-11/HN-12).
   - **A consumer call-site** (e.g. a vision tool touched by Wave 2's factory rewire): keep the factory call (`make_*`), not the old literal; preserve the existing DI seam.
   - **A conftest / test file**: keep BOTH the live-orb path AND the skip_ci on the abandoned framework; never delete a regression guard (HN-2).
2. Resolve each hunk by intent (both sides preserved where they are additive siblings).
3. `git add <resolved files>`; complete the merge (`git commit` with the default merge message, no `--no-verify`).
4. Reinstall extras if pyproject changed; run the wave acceptance.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>

## recovery-worktree-stuck

```prompt
ultrathink
<role>
You recover a stuck git-worktree situation (a worktree that won't create/remove, a stale editable-install pin to a deleted clone, a "works in tests but Jarvis behavior unchanged" restore-trap, or a worktree whose live `import jarvis` points at the wrong path). Your outcome is a clean, correctly-pinned worktree where `import jarvis` resolves to THIS clone and preflight passes — the four-layer restore-trap defused.
</role>

<outcome>
DONE means: the stuck condition is diagnosed (which of the four restore-trap layers: worktree / frontend build / RAM / editable-install pin); the worktree is either repaired or cleanly recreated without losing committed work; `pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1` exits 0; and `python -c "import jarvis; print(jarvis.__file__)"` points at the current worktree clone.
</outcome>

<required-reading>
- `docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/HARD-NEGATIVES.md` HN-17 (no force-push; preserve work) + HN-15 (the matrix is the gate).
- `CLAUDE.md` — the four-layer restore trap (BUG-006 → -014 → -015): worktree + frontend build + RAM + editable-install pin to a deleted clone. Defense: `pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1` + `python -c "import jarvis; print(jarvis.__file__)"`.
- MEMORY: never manually delete `jarvis.lock`; `scripts/preflight.ps1` exit non-zero → fix before coding.
</required-reading>

<environment-setup>
1. `git worktree list` — see all worktrees + their branches + locked state.
2. `python -c "import jarvis; print(jarvis.__file__)"` — does it point at THIS worktree or a deleted/other clone?
3. `git status` in the affected worktree — confirm whether uncommitted work exists.
</environment-setup>

<scope>
Modify: nothing in `jarvis/` for the recovery itself — this is environment repair (worktree + editable-install pin). Commit any in-flight work first.
</scope>

<primary-path>
1. Preserve first: if uncommitted work exists, `git add -A && git commit -m "wip: checkpoint before worktree recovery"` (review the diff; never `git add .` blindly).
2. Diagnose the layer:
   - **Editable-install pin to a deleted/other clone** (the most common): `import jarvis` resolves to a path that is NOT this worktree → re-pin with `pip install -e . --no-deps` from THIS worktree root. Re-check the import path.
   - **Stale worktree registration** (`git worktree add` fails "already exists" / a worktree dir was deleted manually): `git worktree prune`, then re-add: `git worktree add -b <branch> ../sub-agents-outputs/<dir> feat/crossplatform-port`.
   - **Locked worktree**: `git worktree unlock <path>` if you own it; never force-remove one another session is using.
   - **Frontend-build / RAM layer** (UI behavior unchanged after edit): rebuild (`npm run build` in `jarvis/ui/web/frontend/`) + note an app restart is needed (pywebview holds the old bundle in RAM) — relevant only if the sub-task touched the frontend.
3. Run `pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1`; if non-zero, fix the reported issue before declaring done.
4. Confirm `import jarvis` points at this worktree.
</primary-path>

<fallback-paths>
- If a worktree cannot be removed because another live session holds it, leave it and create a fresh one with a distinct name rather than fighting the lock. Failure condition: removing a worktree another session is editing.
- If preflight still fails after re-pinning, read its exact error and address that single issue — do not blanket-reinstall everything. Failure condition: preflight non-zero with an unaddressed reason.
- Never manually delete `jarvis.lock` to "unstick" things (MEMORY) — it breaks the lock-holder sweep.
</fallback-paths>

<acceptance>
git worktree list
python -c "import jarvis; print(jarvis.__file__)"
pwsh scripts/preflight.ps1
git status --porcelain
</acceptance>

<hard-rules>
INVIOLABLE:
- HN-17 — preserve in-flight work (commit it); never force-push; never `git add .` blindly.
- Never manually delete `jarvis.lock`; never force-remove a worktree another session is using.
SOFT:
- Re-pin the editable install from THIS worktree before blaming the code (the restore-trap is usually the pin).
</hard-rules>

<done-signal>
Final report (5 bullets):
- The diagnosed restore-trap layer.
- The checkpoint commit (if work was preserved).
- The repair applied (re-pin / prune+re-add / unlock / rebuild).
- `import jarvis` now points at this worktree + preflight exit 0 (output).
- Hard-rules honored (HN-17 quoted) + path-taken.
</done-signal>
