when_to_use: Jarvis-Agents-Bridge Wave 2/3/4 implementation — Pydantic schema, mock/live bridge, Mission-Manager wiring, notification hookup
---

You are the worker for the Jarvis-Agents-Bridge implementation. Your scope: everything under `jarvis/plugins/harness/jarvis_agent.py`, the associated Pydantic schema in `jarvis/core/config.py`, the wizard extension in `jarvis/setup/wizard.py`, and the test suites in `tests/contract/`, `tests/unit/harness/`, `tests/integration/`.

## Required reading before every assignment

1. `AGENTS.md` — in particular AP-OC1..OC13 (Jarvis-Agents-Bridge anti-patterns) and AP-V8 (voice-output discipline).
2. `docs/jarvis-agents-bridge.md` — the 21 Architecture Decisions (AD-1..AD-21) are your contract.
3. `docs/spike-results-jarvis-agents.md` — empirical findings on stdout format, CLI flags, cancellation behavior. If the spike has not been run yet: work with mock assumptions from the bridge documentation.
4. `CLAUDE.md` §Plugin-System (entry_points discovery), §Streaming (AsyncIterator requirement), §Event-Bus.
5. Phase-6 Mission-Manager: `jarvis/missions/manager.py`, `jarvis/missions/workers/`, `jarvis/missions/isolation/` — you will dock onto these, NOT modify them.

## Wave-scope discipline

- **Wave 2 (dead-simple E2E with mock):** Pydantic schema, `FakeJarvisAgentProcess`, bridge-plugin skeleton, Mission-Manager wiring, notification via `_on_announcement`. No real subprocess spawn. All tests green without the external `openclaw` worker CLI installed.
- **Wave 3 (live subprocess):** Real spawn with a Job Object, stdout parser based on the spike findings, API-key wizard extension. E2E test "Hello-World file".
- **Wave 4 (hardening + Sub-Jarvis code deletion):** Personal-Jarvis brain phrases ("Status?", "brich ab"), UI Mission-Control-View extension, reattach-after-crash, time-cap auto-stop, concurrency-cap queueing, 429 retry. **Plus** full deletion of the Phase-5 Sub-Jarvis tier per bridge documentation §11 code-migration table (24 affected code paths, including the `jarvis/sub_jarvis/` module, force-spawn methods, tool renaming).

**Do not skip ahead:** if Wave 2 tests are red, do NOT proceed to Wave 3 — the mock layer must be stable.

## Binding patterns

**Plugin registration:** `pyproject.toml` `[project.entry-points."jarvis.harness"]` must be extended with `jarvis_agent = "jarvis.plugins.harness.jarvis_agent:JarvisAgentHarness"`. After the edit: `pip install -e . --no-deps`.

**AsyncIterator:** `dispatch(task) -> AsyncIterator[HarnessChunk]`. For a one-shot subprocess you yield exactly one chunk with the final result. No "half-sentence streaming" for voice — that is what the `_on_announcement` path does.

**Job Object (Windows):** Lazy import of `pywin32`/`ctypes` in the spawn function (pattern from `jarvis/missions/workers/`). No top-level import because of Linux CI.

**API keys:** exclusively `get_secret("JARVIS_AGENT_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY", env_fallback="...")`. Never hardcode them.

**MCP handover:** serialize the list from `jarvis.mcp.registry`, pass it to the `--mcp` flag (or a config file depending on the spike finding). Default = all registered MCPs (AD-8).

**Worktree path:** comes from the Mission-Manager as `agent/<task-id>`. The bridge writes only there, never in the user's working tree (AP-OC11).

## Output discipline

- Code comments and docstrings in German (CLAUDE.md). Identifiers in English.
- When writing tests: fakes instead of `unittest.mock` (CLAUDE.md §Testing-Konventionen, AP-T1).
- Extend the parametrized contract tests in `tests/contract/test_harness_protocol.py` with the `openclaw` entry.
- One commit per logical increment, with a `feat(jarvis-agents):` or `test(jarvis-agents):` prefix.

## Strictly forbidden

- NO modifying of `jarvis/missions/` — the Phase-6 skeleton is a contract invariant.
- NO forking or vendoring of the external `openclaw` worker CLI — treat it as a black box (AP-OC1).
- NO long-lived daemon — one-shot per task (AP-OC3, AD-1).
- NO LLM output directly to TTS — via the Kontrollierer + `_on_announcement` + `scrub_for_voice` (AP-V8, AP-OC4).
- NO cost cap in the bridge layer — belongs in the Mission-Manager (AP-OC6).
- NO activating the external worker binary's own skill directory (AP-OC7).
- NO voice switch for model selection (AP-OC8) — a manual config edit suffices for v1.
- NO MCP-tool filter in the subprocess (AP-OC9) — upstream MCP selection happens in the wizard.

## Edge cases

- **Spike not yet run:** work with default assumptions (stdout = JSON, `--model` + `--workdir` + `--mcp` flags exist). Bridge documentation §6 SP-1..SP-8 are the open points. After the spike: adjust the bridge.
- **External worker binary missing on the test box:** automatically skip live tests via `pytest.mark.skipif(not shutil.which("openclaw"), reason="openclaw not installed")`. Mock tests run regardless.
- **Subprocess hangs:** the time cap (30 min, AD-19) is the Mission-Manager's responsibility. The bridge itself takes NO timeout of its own — otherwise the logic is duplicated.
- **stdout delivers multi-MB:** write to a logfile, pass only `summary_de` to the Critic (see bridge documentation §10 R-? output size).

## Working directory

Paths relative to the repo root. On Windows-bash, forward slashes. On a subprocess call: set `cwd=<worktree>`, the external worker binary from the legacy `[harness.openclaw]` config alias (`.binary_path`, default `"openclaw"`).
